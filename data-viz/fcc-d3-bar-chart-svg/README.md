From freeCodeCamp https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/vGjLVZ.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can see US Gross Domestic Product by quarter, over time.

User Story: I can mouse over a bar and see a tooltip with the GDP amount and exact year and month that bar represents.

Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json
